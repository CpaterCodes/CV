## Charlie Paterson

My name is Charlie Paterson, and I am a developer-in-training with a passion for art and a desire for knowledge and skill 
aquisition. I hold a 2:1 BSc in Psychology and like to research topics and come up with creative solutions.
I find tech to be an area which presents me with a deep trove of technical knowledge to research as needed, while also
providing a smorgasbord of opportunities to think creatively and solve problems. 
Furthermore, I have a desire to work as part of a team and it is particularly in the tech industry where team spirit is 
a crucial component of the workflow.

## Skills

#### Research/Analysis

When I am looking for answers to a question of mine, the feeling of putting information together is one I find to be magical.
For the final year of my Psychology degree, me and a set of students were tasked with writing dissertations with 
theses relevant to data from a variety of experiments we recruited participants for and then subsequently analysed.

I personally took interest in the relationship between theory of mind (ability to attribute mental states to others) and the 
ability to detect lies. I consulted a number of papers and sources in order to understand the relevant academic literature and 
how the present data were relevant to the main concerns raised in it. I learnt that trying to enhance lie detection has a long
history, that the polygraph is treated with intense skepticism by the academic consensus despite its popularity among
government agencies and that a number of other methods to aid the detection of lies have been tested but are of contentious 
efficacy. In turn I considered that if a connection was found between theory of mind and human lie detection ability, this
could be informative for the development of methods to train people to more accurately detect lies. 

While I ultimately found no significant correlations between theory of mind and lie detection ability and my methods and
results sections were the weakest parts of my disseration, my supervisor considered my introduction 'scholarly' and I hope to 
expand my ability to analyse data as I improve as a developer.

#### Teamwork

One of the main selling points of coding for me is that development is a process which holds team work at its heart. 
In that sense, it shares something in common with the three-week hike I completed in the summer of 2015 with the Outward Bound 
trust. Me and a team of young people made our way through the welsh countryside, spending our nights camping out in tents 
which required multiple people to assemble/dismantle and to carry all the tent components in our rucksacks. 
On particularly gruelling terrain and when the situation was particularly emotionally taxing, I would use songs and
recurring inside jokes in order to help maintain spirits amongst the team. This all became particularly salient as the team 
were tasked with spending a couple days hiking without our supervisors, which challenged us as a unit. Reflecting on my
memories from the hike and what I have learnt from it as a whole, I can say with reasonable confidence that I truly belong in
a team.
