# Charlie Paterson

## Introducing myself

I am Charlie Paterson, a rookie developer with a passion for creation and a desire for knowledge and skill 
acquisition. 
I hold a 2:1 BSc in Psychology and like to research topics and come up with creative solutions, but I've truly found my passion with tech.
I find it to be an area which challenges me to undergo extensive research into technical topics as needed, while also
providing a smorgasbord of opportunities to think creatively and solve problems. 
Furthermore, I have a desire to work as part of a team and find the common practice of pair programming in the tech industry
to be great for my productivity and idea generation.

I blog on occasion at https://dev.to/cpatercodes about code and related topics.

## Skills

#### Research/Analysis

When I am looking for answers to a question of mine, the feeling of delving into a subject to get to that point is always an 
adventure I value. For the final year of my Psychology degree, me and a set of students were tasked with writing dissertations
with theses relevant to data from a variety of experiments we recruited participants for and then subsequently analysed.

I personally took interest in the relationship between theory of mind (ability to attribute mental states to others) and the 
ability to detect lies. I consulted a number of papers and sources in order to understand the relevant academic literature and 
how the present data were relevant to the main concerns raised in it. I learnt that trying to enhance lie detection has a long
history, that the polygraph is treated with intense skepticism by the academic consensus despite its popularity among
government agencies and that a number of other methods to aid the detection of lies have been tested but are of contentious 
efficacy. In turn I considered that if a connection was found between theory of mind and human lie detection ability, this
could be informative for the development of methods to train people to more accurately detect lies. 

My supervisor considered my introduction 'scholarly' and I hope to bring my analytical abilities to a programming role.

#### Teamwork

One of the main selling points of coding for me is that development is a process which holds team work at its heart. 
In that sense, it shares something in common with the three-week hike I completed in the summer of 2015 with the Outward Bound 
trust. Me and a team of young people made our way through the welsh countryside, spending our nights camping out in tents 
which required multiple people to assemble/dismantle and to carry all the tent components in our rucksacks. 
On particularly gruelling terrain and when the situation was particularly emotionally taxing, I would use
conversation in order to help maintain spirits amongst the team. This all became particularly salient as the team 
were tasked with spending a small number of days hiking without our supervisors, which challenged us as a unit. Reflecting on my
memories from the hike and what I have learnt from it as a whole, I can say with reasonable confidence that I truly belong in
a team.

#### Exploring new technologies

A big part of being a developer - and more broadly, in the world of work and life as a whole - is not being afraid to explore
new technology, new methods, or more generally new ways of accomplishing your goals. An example that still sticks with me
comes from my final group project with Makers Academy wherein our team decided we wanted to try and build something with
Unreal engine 4. There was an option to program classes directly in C++ but also a graphical interface through which you could 
assemble their logic instead. While at first this latter option seemed alien to us, we were able to interpret it in terms of
the knowledge of core programming concepts and tools we had learnt at Makers. In turn, we were able to assemble a rather basic
game with the engine. While we were still just beginning to scratch the service of Unreal engine as a technology, I feel
proud of what we were able to accomplish in a fortnight.

## Education

## Work Experience

From May 2020 to September 2020 in the midst of the COVID-19 Pandemic, I was able to secure remote work from Tiberone, an IT consultancy agency who were 
developing a data visualisation interface for a much larger telecommunications firm. 
In this time I had various tasks, from shadowing SQL developers on the project to explaining DevOps concepts to non-technical colleagues and gathering relevant
administrative information to assist the companyâ€™s operation in challenging times.

In the summer of 2019, I also undertook information retrieval and factsheet writing for the non-formal learning organisation CLOCK. 
This involved reading and taking notes from multiple academic sources at the British library which I would later condense into a useful summary.

During the summer of 2019, I engaged in two weeks of temporary work with the City University administration in the school of arts and social sciences, entering
data from questionnaires into microsoft excel and subsequently calibrating spreadsheets to graph the data and perform tests of statistical significance.

(Currently jobhunting with Makers academy, so no coding related work experience yet).
